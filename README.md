CSS Responsive Styling Design Assignment I Was Assigned

In this project I was given a template to follow, and a partially-finished project.

The goal was to match the template.

This project was frustrating, mostly because of the information my course-content neglected to divulge.

I'm so tired, so very tired. This was rough for an early assignment.
